rabbitMQ  依赖着2 个jar 包，slf4j-api-1.6.6.jar，slf4j-simple-1.6.6.jar



PORT 4369: Erlang makes use of a Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) for resolution of node names in a cluster. Nodes must be able to reach each other and the port mapper daemon for clustering to work.

PORT 35197 set by inet_dist_listen_min/max Firewalls must permit traffic in this range to pass between clustered nodes

RabbitMQ Management console:

- PORT 15672 for RabbitMQ version 3.x
- PORT 55672 for RabbitMQ pre 3.x

PORT `5672` RabbitMQ main port.

For a cluster of nodes, they must be open to each other on `35197`, `4369` and `5672`.

For any servers that want to use the message queue, only `5672` is required
